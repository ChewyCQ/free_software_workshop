This guide will show you how to track and kill processes using the linux terminal

ps - process status app

Common usage

ps -Af # this will bring you the information of all linux processes that are being executed and it's process ids

ps -Af | grep [process_name] # this will show you the specific process required by the regular expression

Once you have the process ID you have to run the following command and make sure that the process is running under your user, otherwise you have tu add `sudo`

kill -9 [process_id]
or
sudo kill -9 [process_id]

to bring the process to the front you have to run

fg

and kill the process with `ctrl + c`
